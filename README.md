* Save your API key for use on patent queries.
* Issue valid queries using API key.



## Contributing

### Reporting bugs

### Requesting features

Feature requests can go into the issue tracking system as well, and
we'll add the more interesting feature requests to a high-priority todo
list below.

#### TODO

* Remove case sensitivity in queries.


### Test database provisioning

* [Using rake to handle sqlite3 to postgres
conversion](http://blog.renaud.io/2011/10/05/rails-3-migrate-your-data-from-sqlite-to-postgresql/)

* `lib/tasks/importdummy.rake` handles importing the 3000 record
pre-production test data.

* `db/csv/*.csv` are the 3000 record files corresponding to tables in
the database. These are loaded using the rake task.

* Getting the data up to the server is best done with the heroku
`pgbackups:restore` command.
